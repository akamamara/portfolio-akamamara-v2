		description:
			"I started my journey in UI Design in my early college year. It’s a fun field and challenging because a good understanding of user needs and behavior is a must key to mastering and that is not my major experience. A nice design is important indeed, but when no one understands how to use it, it is waste of time. Thanks to this field, I can emphasize what users wanted and need in a software.",

		description:
			"I’ve been enthusiastic about web development since mid-school. Since then, I keep up to date with web technology which so influences me to choose my college degree, Computer Science! In my last two years, I've joined a freelancer group based in Bogor, Indonesia, Codepanda. I've got the opportunity to join four projects, three of them acting as Frontend Developers with ReactJS and CSS libraries, as well as Tailwind and MaterialUI. Currently, I’m extending my horizon to other web technologies, such as Svelte, TypeScript, and many more. ",

		title: "Mobile Development",
		description:
			"I start digging into mobile development during my final year thesis. I develop existing apps, FamLink. This is a challenging and radical change for me because I'm usually used to functional programming besides object-oriented programming. But, in the end, I overcome those challenges by gaining a satisfactory delivery to my client as the installed apps raised from 800 to 900 plus as of March 2022. This makes me more motivated to extend my horizon on frontend development, that not limited to web development, but extends to mobile even more to cross-platform development, especially Flutter.",
